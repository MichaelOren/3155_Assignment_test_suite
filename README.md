# 3155 Assignment 1 test suite

Put your assignment files into this repo and run the tester for the questions


Please don't push class content or files that will cause collusion, I don't need to go into academic review for trying to help

You will need to change the function names in each of the testing files since yours might differ from mine

You may have issues with importing your file for q2 or gusfields, just add these files to the main directory (above question folders)
