# 3155 Assignment 1 test suite



## How to run the tests:
Put your assignment files into this repo and run the tester files for each of the questions

## How to add tests:
There are files that are specifically for adding lines of tests to, add the pattern to the pattern file, then **on the same number line in the text file**, add the text line

Please don't push class content or files that will cause collusion, I don't need to go into academic review for trying to help


### Note
* You will need to change the function names in each of the testing files since yours might differ from mine

* You may have issues with importing your file for q2 or gusfields, just add these files to the main directory (above question folders)
